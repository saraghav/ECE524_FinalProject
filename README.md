# ECE524_FinalProject

ECE524 - Introduction to Optimization (Final Project)

## Getting Started

Please read the markdown sections that I've written in the two files:
* setup_dependecies.ipynb
* main_ananth.ipynb

Please add any important common information (like paper/pdf references etc.) in this place. I've already started that below. This document uses the same markdown syntax that we use in our IJulia notebooks.
