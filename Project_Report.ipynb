    "Mosaicking is an old art technique where pictures or designs are formed by inlaying small bits of colored stone, glass, or tile. These small bits are visible close up, but the boundaries of the bits will blend and a single recognizable image will show at a distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern digital world, this acient art form has been transformed and combined with new technologies. As one has access to large public image database, individual images, instead of pure-colored blocks can be used as tiles to make pictures. Here is a famous mosaic image of president Obama made by [Anne Savage](http://news.siu.edu/2009/01/011509amh9004.php) during his campaign.\n",
    "![Obama](http://news.siu.edu/_assets/images/2009/01/asavage_mosaic.jpg)\n",
    "Nearly 6,000 images of individual faces are used to create this image. Sure enough, it has become a very popular poster because of the special art form. Using image mosaicking to form various pictures is very cool and seems like a daunting task because we are picking and arranging thousands of pictures from a even bigger pool of pictures. There are businesses helping you create your own mosaic work with charge. However, with intuition and just a little knowledge of optimization, we can do it at home ourselves!\n",
    "\n",
    "We know images consist of pixels, and each pixel can be described using RGB color intensities. In order for two images to look alike, we just need to match their pixels. In this case, for the image to show at a distance, intuitively, we can just treat the basis images as \"super pixels\" and try to match them with the corresponding subimage of the target image. Naturally, we will take the target image and partition it into a grid, where each grid element is our tile size. Then for each grid, we will choose one image from the basis that resembles the most. The way to qualify \"resemblance\" is discussed in detail in Part II - there are many ways of doing this. This project explores a few different ways of doing this. Because each chosen basis image resembles the grid best, after processing all grids, we will end up with a mosaicking image that overall best resembles the whole image. Notice that this is the most intuitive way to solve the problem, and it will always achieve the best result. We will present the solution using this method in the first section of Part III. This brute force method is limited by its speed; variants of the algorithm that speeds the process up will be discussed. We will also explore how changing the size of the tiles will affect the performance. The image basis in this project are obtained from online source [mazaika](http://www.mazaika.com/mazdownload.html) and generic results from Google Image Search.\n",

    "## 2. Mathematical model - Mixed Integer Program Formulation ##\n",
    "\n",
    "From the introduction above, it is clear that intuitive approach to image mosaicking is an **assignment problem** which can be modeled as a **Mixed Integer Program**. Let's setup the problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A set of \"basis\" images - these are the images we will use as tiles to reconstruct the so-called \"test\" image (which we are trying to reporoduce). The set of \"basis\" images constitute the set $\\mathbf{B}$\n",
    "* Create a grid of equally sized sub-images from the target image - each sub-image will be a grid element. The smaller we make the grid element, the higher the quality of the resulting mosaic will be. The set of all the grid elements constitute the set $\\mathbf{I}$.\n",
    "  * Of course, the quality also depends on the diversity of colors in our \"test\" image and the diversity of colors in our \"basis\" set.\n",
    "  * The size of the grid elements and the size of the \"basis\" images must be the same to be consistent (each grid-element is a tile location and each \"basis\" image is a tile that needs to fit into a tile location). Let this size be represented by $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **decision variables** $G_i,i\\in\\mathbf{I}$ ($\\mathbf{I}$ is the set of all grid elements in target image) are which image (represented by its index $j\\in\\mathbf{B}$, where $\\mathbf{B}$ is the set of basis images of size $s$) to choose for each grid $i$ of the target image. Therefore, $\\mathbf{B}$ represent the restricted set of values $G_i$ can take (in other words, we can choose exactly ONE basis image as the tile to be placed in ONE grid-element). In the mathematical formulation, binary variable for each basis images is introduced to indicate whether a particular basis image is chosen for a grid-element location. For a single grid-element, the variables that indicate assignment of a basis image to that grid-element must satisfy the **SOS constraint** (only one image can be chosen). The **objective** is to minimize the visual difference$^*$ between the chosen mosaic and the target image. Note the difference function should be linear for the model to be MIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "($^*$ _Several non-linear functions can be used to describe the resemblance of the grid and the basis image and be implemented within special algorithms. But they fall out of the scope of this course and are not discussed here._)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth pointing out that in the current formulation, the optimization of each grid is independent from one another. Therefore, we can lessen the solvers burden by forming a model that solves the sub-problem of optimizing each grid element. To optimize the whole target image, one can simply put the optimization model in a function and call it for each grid element of the image. Let's use the following notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $m$ represents the size of a grid-element along the Y-axis (same as the **height** of a basis image)\n",
    "* $n$ represents the size of a grid-element along the X-axis (same as the **width** of a basis image)\n",
    "\n",
    "For grid-element size $m \\times n$, each target grid-element can be represented by $m\\times n\\times 3$ RGB matrix $G$. Before optimization, basis images are pre-processed so that they all have the same size as the grid-elements. Each basis image is represented as $m\\times n\\times 3$ RGB matrix $B_j,j\\in\\mathbf{B}$. There are many different ways to quantify the similarity/dis-similarity between any basis and the target sub-image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we have limited the grid sizes to $2^p\\times 2^p,~p\\in\\{3,\\ldots,6\\}$ square grids for the sake of scaling the basis. Further, we make sure the target image can be divided perfectly into integer number of grids. We have explored several different cost functions, and the formulation of each is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various heuristics to improve the image matching are also explored in the subsequent sections."

    "The first formulation is the most straight forward yet most expensive way. The number of varibles and constraints scales with the size of the target image. Further, by trying to match individual pixels, one may not necessarily get the best performance because mosaicking is more about overall resemblance at a distance. As a result, the optimization model using this objective fuction is not shown in the solution part.\n",

    "Considering matching individual pixels is very expensive and all we care about is the images look close at a distance. It is straight forward to treat each basis image as a whole. We can extract features from the picture. Two most frequently used are the mean (average) of the pixel RGB intensities and the mode (most frequent value) of the pixel RGB. Both of these are implemented."

    "The mode does not capture subtle variations in the color in a sub-image - the histogram paints a far better picture of the color variations within a sub-image, and histogram based matching should be closer to our own visual perception.

    "Notice the brute force way is very slow because the SOS constraint has the size of the whole basis array for each sub-problem. Further, the result is not very satisfying at some points. It is worth noting that smallest $L_1$ norm does not necessarily guarantee similar color appearance. For example at the lower right corner, the brownish basis is chosen for the dark blue regions. To address this, we can preprocess both the grid and basis images by identifying the dominant color. The simple way is to find the color with the largest average intensity. By doing this, we roughly reduces the basis size for each sub-problem to $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the original basis size. Additionally, we guarantee the basis image we choose for each grid has the same dominant color as the grid itself.\n",

Consquently, when compared against the diverse set of 500 images used with the iterative MIP approach, the performance appears worse. However, the trend of observing better performance with more downscaling is apparent here as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The quality of the mosaic is highly dependent on the diversity of colors in the basis set and the diversity of colors in the test image\n",
    "* Visual image similarity is not always quantified by individual pixel-pixel matching\n",
    "  * Although the specific example used above shows extremely good results when the mean absolute difference is used as the similarity criterion, this does not always work for all images. For the sake of brevity, only the strong results have been shown above, but the user can try different combinations of scales, basis sets and test images using the interactive elements in [Section 8](#8.-Bonus:-try-it-yourself)\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some suggestions for future work:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Solving a Square Jigsaw Puzzle**\n",
    "  * If a similarity criterion can be established between every pair of image pieces, concepts similar to the ones used here can be used to arrange the pieces on a grid, based on the similarity criterion (the real image is not provided)\n",
    "  * The challenge is in making the approach scalable. Calculating the similarity criterion is of the order $O(n!)$, where $n$ is the number of pieces of the image\n",
    "* **Edge Detection in Images**\n",
    "  * The LP formulation gives some good insight into how edge-detection can translate itself to an optimization problem\n",
    "  * By identifying regions of the image that maximize the color difference between adjacent pixels (or adjacent groups of pixels a.k.a grid elements) edges can be detected. A tradeoff parameter can be used to decide how sensitive the edge detection will be to color variations in the image\n",
    "  * The challenge is in coming up with the right formulation that connects information for all the three color channels (R, G, B) to identify the edge in the image.\n",
    "* **Improving the speed of the LP formulation as presented in this report**\n",
    "  * The LP formulation works exceedingly fast (<2 minutes) if the downscaling factor is less than or equal to 3 (going up to 16x16) for a 960x640 image. However, for a downscaling setting of 4 (going up to 8x8), the runtime is ~0.5 hours. To address this difference, one LP solution can be found with lower downscaling and sub-sections of the image with higher error could be chosen for further optimization (with higher downscaling settings).\n",
    "  * This way, since the higher downscaling optimizations happen on a smaller image, the runtime and the memory requirements will be reduce and computation could be tractable\n",
    "  * The challenge is in adaptively identifying sub-sections of the image that could be optimized further to improve overall performance given the tradeoff setting"
